It seems inefficient to iterate over the document trees for a number of times. 
However, this is really necessary given all the different requirements.  

1st pass over document trees:
HitaextDoc.init_elems(self, side, tree)

- performed only for new documents
- requires two document trees (of type IndexElemTree)
- initializes the <render> section, setting the skip, ignore, newline, blankline,
  and ignore attributes to their default values for each element occurring in the 
  document tree 
- initializes pseudoRoot to the docuemnt tree root


2nd pass over document trees:
IndexElemTree.update(self, ignoreTags=[], newlineTags=[], blanklineTags=[])

- requires ignore, newline, blankline attributes
  (as ignoreTags, newlineTags, blanklineTags lists)
- requires pseudoRoot
- initializes the _start, _end, _alignments and _n attributes
- constructs the tagCountTable which maps from tag count to element
- derives the text string
- note that IndexElemTree.update is not called from IndexElemTree.__init__
  to allow the document trees in the 1st pass to be IndexElemTrees already
- called every time render options change, 
  but then without changing tagCountTable or _alignments


3rd pass over document trees:
AlignFrame.injectAlignment(self, alignTree)

- requires _alignment attribute and tagCountTable,
  hence cannot be merged with the 2nd pass
- fills _alignment list acording to <alignment> section in hitaext document
- this is not really a full pass over the document trees, 
  because it iterates over the elements in the <alignment> section of the HitaextDoc;
  hence it cannot be merged with the 4th pass


4th pass over document trees:
HitaextTreeCtrl.processElemTree(self, pseudoRoot=None, skipTags=[])

- requires pseudoRoot and skip attributes (as skipTags list)
- requires _alignments
- creates corresponding  items of HitaextTreeCtrl, 
  setting them aligned (green font color) or unaligned (red font color)
- adds _item back-pointer attribute to access item from element
- might be merged with 2nd pass, but then things become very messy
- called every time render options change


5th pass over document trees:
AlignFrame.extractAlignment(self, alignTree)

- performed only when saving documents
- replace the links in the <alignments> section of the Hitaext XML document 
  according to the alignments in both ElemTreeCtrls
